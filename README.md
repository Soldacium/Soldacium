# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## As you can see, my name's Wojciech and I welcome you to my github profile. <br> Here I upload my projects for viewing, most commonly after I've done them.
   

Feel free to visit [my repositories](https://github.com/Soldacium?tab=repositories) any time you want, check out my code and maybe learn with me? Who knows;

### ALSO, maybe more introduction is in order?
Well, as of now I am (aspiring) front-end developer/(pending) CS student. I'm 20 years old, and while I'm quite new both to this world as to web development scene, I make my best effort to learn as much as I can, do projects and do them good.

# Personal stuff
I enjoy going to gym, biking, hiking, reading books and doing bizzare stuff with my friends whenever I can.

### How do I work?

**Soldacium/Soldacium** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
