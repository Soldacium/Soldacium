# Hi there 👋

## As you can see, my name's Wojciech and I welcome you to my github profile. Here I upload my projects for viewing, most commonly after I've done them.
  
Feel free to visit [my repositories](https://github.com/Soldacium?tab=repositories) any time you want, check out my code and maybe learn with me? Who knows;
<br><br><br>

# ALSO, maybe more proper introduction is in order? 🙂
Well, as of now I am (aspiring) front-end developer/(pending) CS student. I'm 20 years old, and while I'm quite new both to this world as to web development scene, I make my best effort to learn as much as I can, do projects and do them good. I won't bore you with my whole hisotry, but if you want to learn more check out [myWebsite](https://soldacium.github.io/portfolio)

I enjoy going to gym, biking, hiking, reading books and doing bizzare stuff with my friends whenever I can.
New expirences and gathering knowledge are my main objectives.
